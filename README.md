# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### This project analyzes Kickstarter data collected between 2009 and 2017 focusing on Theater campaign launch dates and overall funding goals. 
###Purpose
#### The purpose is to analyze and visualize campaigns based on their success rate relating to launch dates and fundraising goals. 
### Sheet: Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
#### Converted dates from Unix to dates. Separated Parent and Subcategorys. Used pivot table to sort campaigns by:Year, Month and Category, focusing only on the failed and successful campaigns. 
### Sheet: Outcomes Based on Goals
#### Used VLOOKUP and COUNTIFS to create a table showing number of successful, failed and canceled campaigns based on original goal. Created line chart showing results of Percentage vs Goal

## Analysis and Challenges

### Based on these findings,campaigns started in the spring time [May - July] had a higher success rate than those started in colder months. May had the most successful campaigns (111). 
    Launch date was less influential when looking at failed or canceled campaigns.

##Launch Date vs Goals
####Campaigns asking for a lower amount of money ($1 - $15,000) had a higher success rate of meeting their goal.The one outlier as funding goals increase is in the $40k to 45K range. Setting a goal between those numbers would give a higher change at success.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
